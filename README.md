This is an experimental project that aims to manage and analyze financial income and expense records through a **Group / Unit** data organization model. As the project name suggests, the program itself does not embed any specific analysis logic; all analysis strategies and computation processes are entirely determined by plugins.

The goal of this project is not to build a fully featured financial system, but to explore a **scalable and replaceable analysis architecture** through clear data layering (Group / Unit) and a plugin-based analysis mechanism.

You can find the complete design documentation and other necessary information in the `docs` directory.
